Chapter 1
Location: Colonization Ship headed towards Mars
Date/Time 4/16/2028 10:27 GMT
  The day began on the colonization ship like any other. The lamps were shining and the air was freshly scrubbed. "Goodmorning Alex. Sleep Well?"
  "I would if you didn't snore so loudly Jessica." I responded. "Any news from Earth?" She shook her head.
    Before she could respond an alarm sounded informing us of our proximity growing ever closer to Mars. I immeadiately grabbed my (Pilot?) gear for the descent and started running towards the command module, only stopping to grab a quick dehydrated food pouch on my way there.
    As I stepped through the threshold of the main door a prodigious din assailed my ears. Reluctantly I made my way to my station and logged on to the Console. (In Italics) Welcome Alex. Your job today will be preprogramming the descent. (End Italics)
    Quickly I started typing commands for the descent and landing sequences.
